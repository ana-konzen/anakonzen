## Background

Flash Art is a quarterly magazine known for featuring emerging and avant-garde
artists. It was founded in Milan in 1967, and has been publishing in both
Italian and English since 1978.

In its early years, Flash Art had a tradition of artists intervening by defacing
the logo and front cover.

## Concept

Inspired by artist interventions, I designed a Flash Art logo that is
ever-changing, constantly being “defaced” by scribbles inspired by the artists
featured in each issue of the magazine. The design aims to capture the spirit of
each artist and their work while maintaining a unified aesthetic.

## Process

An image of an artist’s work is analyzed by OpenAI Vision. The use of AI, paired
with a flexible design, offers a completely personalized logo for each issue of
the magazine.

## An example analysis

The data from the AI is extensively processed to generate the final result. The
following is a summary of some key points, although it does not represent the
full extent of the analysis.

## Usage

Each issue of the magazine features several artists that can be represented in
the logo.

To accomplish this and create a unique identity for the issue, each artist
“scribble” can be stacked up and blended.

After several layers, the original logo becomes almost completely hidden.

## Generator

The logo has a custom generator with an artist database, so that it can be
completely customized.

## Usage: Website

The stacked strategy is primarily used on the website, as a way to tease the
upcoming issue.

Each week, a new layer is added to the logo in the Flash Art website, each based
on one artist of the upcoming issue.

By the time of the print magazine publication, the online logo is completely
defaced—as if all the artists had scribbled on the logo.

## Usage: Print

Several covers per issue, each focusing on a featured artist.
