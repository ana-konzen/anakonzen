## Concept

Brushed emerged from my wish to combine music with artistic process. I aimed to
combine different aspects of music with natural brush textures to create a
data-visualization project that generates a painting in real time, where art
interacts with music.

## Process(Code)

The user submits an audio file of their chosen song, alongside the song's title
and artist name. The data is sent to the Genius and LRC LIB APIs to generate
timestamped lyrics. This information is then submitted to the OpenAI API, which
separates the song into 5-10 main sections, each with its own dataset.

## process (data visualization)

Leveraging p5.sound and the Web Audio API, I mapped each painting into different
fields dictated by different pitches found in the song, creating Voronoi fields
with D3.js.

## process (brushes)

I created a mini-library with custom brush textures, which were then used to
create the paintings.

## example output: "Hannah Hunt" by Vampire Weekend

PS.: this is my favorite song :) Unmute the video to follow along with the song.
