## Background

MALBA (Museo de Arte Latinoamericano de Buenos Aires) is a museum in Buenos
Aires, Argentina. As of 2024, it is the largest museum dedicated to Latin
American art in the world.

Although Latin America is extremely diverse, MALBA’s mission has always been to
connect and represent the entirety of it.

## Concept

I strove to find a way to highlight this mission through an ever changing logo,
representing the diversity and change within Latin America.

## Design

The generative logo is composed by cells of randomized length, angle, and color,
but that are always interconnected.

## Color

The color palette is based on the flags of the countries represented by the
museum.
