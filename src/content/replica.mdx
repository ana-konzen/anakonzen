## Replica

Replica is a fragrance line by Maison Margiela. It offers evocative and
immersive scents inspired by life’s moments and locations.

## Concept

Replica perfumes are a unique concept: they represent the ephemeral quality of
both scent and memories. The new label design highlights the brand’s concept
through an abstract representation of scent traces.

The name of each scent is written following the traces, in a script font meant
to highlight the personal aspect of each perfume.

## Data Visualization

Each aspect of the design is carefully considered to illustrate each perfume’s
scent and the memory it evokes.

## Automated Generation

The label generator is linked to a Google spreadsheet, where new scents can be
added and new labels are automatically generated.

## Two Generators

For even more flexibility, the design shipped with a second generator that tests
visual representations of new scents.

## Putting it all together

The original bottle was kept, with the new label design merging seamlessly with
the organic materials.
