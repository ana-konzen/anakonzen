## Background

In the 1960s, Yves Klein started producing his _Anthropometries_—elaborate
performances where nude models, covered in Klein’s Blue, moved around the canvas
while Klein’s _Monotone Symphony_ played.

The music, which consists of 20 minutes of a persistent D major followed by 20
minutes of silence, served as a guide to the models. While the major chord
played, the models were able to move and paint themselves in the canvas. During
the silence, they stopped moving.

## Concept

Several women participated in the production of the _Anthropometries_, but
little focus has been given to them throughout art history—they are seen as
tools for the creation of the paintings, with little to no agency.

Yves Klein himself called them his “human brushes.”

“Reclaiming Klein” was thus born through a wish of reclaiming, or exposing, the
point of view of the women who made the _Anthropometries_ come to life.

## Process

I leveraged two motion capture programs (Moves by Maxon and Rokoko Studio) and
recorded myself moving to the sound of _Monotone Symphony_. These captures were
then used to create the final composition.

## 3D Composition

The 3D rendering was created with Cinema4D and Redshift. I mixed several of the
motion captures to create the final composition and built a multi-camera set up
meant to mimic a first-person perspective.

## Final Output

After rendering, I composed the result in After Effects and added _Monotone
Symphony_.

The video is meant as a tool for contemplation. I haven’t added much content or
exposition, only the word “reclaiming” in the beginning.
