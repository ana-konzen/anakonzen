## The article

Written by Erwin R. Tiongson, the Washington Post op-ed analyzes on Hot Wheels
cars and their relationship to economics through the “made in” label at the
bottom of them.

## Concept

The author reflects on the example of a toy car made in Malaysia in both the
1970s and 2016, highlighting the contrast between economies that thrive and
those that remain stagnant over time. I took this as the key concept for my
illustration: one car is never able to move forward, no matter how much it
tries.

## Implementation

I hand-coded a website for the article, with an animated illustration as part of
the website. In my illustration, rows of moving grayscale toy cars represent the
forward momentum of global economies, with each car progressing in unison.
However, a single red car is unable to move beyond a certain point before a
black claw—similar to that of an arcade, or a factory—lifts it and places it
back in the row.

As you scroll through the page and read the article, the rows of cars slowly
disappear before the single red car drops down.

## Print

I also designed a printed version of the illustration.
